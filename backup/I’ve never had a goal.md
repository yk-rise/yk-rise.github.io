
I can’t remember having a goal. An actual goal.

There are things I’ve wanted to do, but if I didn’t do them I’d be fine with that too. There are targets that would have been nice to hit, but if I didn’t hit them I wouldn’t look back and say I missed them.

I don’t aim for things that way.

I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I’ve never set a goal. It’s just not how I approach things.

A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you’ve reached it, it’s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don’t function in steps like that.

When you shift from 1st to 2nd, 1st is behind you. Then from 2nd to 3rd, 2nd is behind you. I approach things continuously, not in stops. I just want to keep going — whatever happens along the way is just what happens.


这是BaseCamp 公司创始人 Jason Fried 的一篇短文，应该能够解释为什么一些人在考上大学之后，就彻底的放飞自我，原因也许是因为他们把考大学看作是一个目标，达到了目标也就到终点了，即“A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. ”。与其说是目标，不如说是前进的中断，而作者认为是目标把前进的中断了。

前进，奋斗是连续的，没有说一劳永逸的，我的语文老师就喜欢说一句话“打起精神来，忙完这阵子，再忙下阵子”。既然前进没有停歇，那么如何前进的策略也就不一样了。要知道这是一场超级漫长的马拉松，就像23年哈尔滨的马拉松一样，甚至都能在过程中吃完一场流水席。所以休息是必要的，停下来散步也是必要的。在过检查点的时候，稍稍加速也是必要的。完成一个里程，也不必欣喜若狂，淡然接收，继续慢跑即可。
